    "# Human-AI Interaction in Spatial Environments: A Research Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposal outlines a study to investigate human-AI interaction dynamics in a 2D spatial multiplayer environment. By creating a controlled setting where participants interact with both human peers and AI agents (without knowing which is which), we aim to generate a unique dataset of conversational data and answer fundamental questions about how AI agents influence and are influenced by human communication patterns in situated contexts.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Research Questions & Investigative Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Detection & Perception**: Can humans reliably distinguish between AI agents and human participants in a spatial conversational setting? What behavioral or linguistic cues do they use?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Influence Dynamics**: How does the presence of AI agents (at varying ratios) affect human communication patterns, including:\n",
    "   - Conversational topics and depth\n",
    "   - Turn-taking and response patterns\n",
    "   - Spatial movement and coordination behaviors\n",
    "   - Social dynamics and group formation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **AI Adaptation**: How do AI agents adapt their behavior when interacting with humans versus other agents? Do they converge toward human-like patterns or maintain distinct characteristics?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dataset Quality**: What makes this spatial conversational dataset unique compared to traditional chat datasets, and how can it be used for training future LLMs?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secondary Investigative Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Baseline Comparison**: Establish baseline communication patterns for pure human-human and pure AI-AI interactions\n",
