    "We've successfully added objects and activities to the 2D world:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Object System**: Objects exist at specific locations with types and descriptions\n",
    "2. **Discovery**: Agents automatically discover objects when they get close\n",
    "3. **Interaction**: Agents can interact with objects using [USE: OBJECT_NAME]\n",
    "4. **Conversation Topics**: Objects create new topics for agents to discuss\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spatial Awareness**: Agents know about nearby objects\n",
    "- **Object Types**: Tools, landmarks, and items serve different purposes\n",
    "- **Activity Descriptions**: Interactions are logged and visible to all agents\n",
    "- **Emergent Behavior**: Agents may seek out objects or discuss what they find\n",
    "\n",
    "This foundation enables:\n",
    "- Richer conversation topics\n",
    "- Goal-oriented agent behavior\n",
    "- Human-AI collaboration around shared objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work could explore:\n",
    "- Object properties and states (e.g., doors that can be locked)\n",
    "- Multi-agent object interactions (e.g., two agents using a tool together)\n",
    "- Object persistence and ownership\n",
    "- Dynamic object generation\n"
