      "Below are UI patterns that balance spatial play with rich conversation, tuned for human–AI interaction in a 2D grid world. They’re organized by design area with concrete recommendations for desktop vs. mobile and casual vs. power users.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Time model: real-time, with turn-safe affordances\n",
      "- Default: continuous real-time world with local “focus bubbles.” When a player opens a deep chat or a multi-step action, nearby AI participants become “anchored” (reduced wander, slower tick) so the convo doesn’t run away, but the rest of the world continues.\n",
      "- Soft turns for dialog: when you send a message, the AI gets a short priority window to reply (e.g., 1–3 seconds). Show a subtle countdown ring on their avatar.\n",
      "- “Safe interactions” in crowds: proximity throttling prevents more than N agents from speaking at once to the player; others queue.\n",
      "- Asynchronous fallback: if the user leaves or times out, conversations convert into threads pinned to the location, and agents can leave mail/quests in a mailbox.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) World visualization: readable, spatial, and chat-aware\n",
      "- Camera: player-centered with look-ahead; zoom between character-level (chat-focused) and area-level (navigation). Keep speech bubbles legible at all zooms (scale text, clamp max lines).\n",
      "- Layers: ground → objects → agents → UI. Interactables glow on hover/tap with a thin, colorblind-safe outline.\n",
      "- Mini-map + breadcrumb: top-left mini-map shows agent pips and conversation pins; hover reveals last utterance snippet; breadcrumb trail shows the player’s recent path.\n",
      "- Conversation pins: threads anchored to tiles show a small chat-head bubble; clicking warps camera to that node and opens the thread.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Control schemes and input\n",
      "Desktop\n",
      "- Movement: WASD or right-click-to-move; mouse hover shows contextual tooltips. Scroll to zoom.\n",
      "- Interaction: left-click = primary interact; right-click opens a radial menu (Talk, Give, Trade, Follow, Inspect).\n",
      "- Chat: Enter to focus chat. Shift+Enter for new line. Esc exits chat focus. “@Name” autocomplete and object chips you can click to insert references.\n",
      "- Power action: Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd+K) with natural language and slash-commands (e.g., /ask @Barkeep for bread). Number keys for quick actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mobile\n",
      "- Movement: tap-to-move by default; optional floating joystick. Two-finger pan, pinch-to-zoom.\n",
      "- Interaction: single-tap to select, long-press for radial menu near the finger.\n",
      "- Chat: bottom-sheet chat that slides up over 30–40% of the screen; quick-reply chips above the keyboard; voice-to-text button; haptic ticks for send/receive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Text-first and accessibility\n",
      "- Slash-commands mirror every UI action. Autocomplete shows verbs and targets.\n",
      "- Screen reader mode: list view of nearby entities sorted by distance; actions exposed as buttons; speech as threaded lists.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Conversations: in-world bubbles + structured side panel\n",
      "- In-world bubbles: short, 1–2 line previews anchored to avatars; fade quickly; show mention highlights and emotes.\n",
      "- Conversation panel: collapsible side or bottom sheet shows full transcripts, threading for group interactions, and message reactions. Pin a convo to keep it open while exploring.\n",
      "- Proximity chat: auto-joins when within radius; offers “Follow me,” “Step aside,” and “Talk privately” chips to manage crowding.\n",
      "- DM/Party channels: sidebar tabs; messages show small avatar route indicators to keep spatial awareness.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Agent status, intent, and explainability\n",
      "- Status rings above avatars: color/state-coded (available, busy, thinking, moving, in-combat, trading). Typing dots when composing.\n",
      "- Intent preview: subtle path arrows and verb labels (e.g., “Heading to Market”). Hover/tap opens a one-line “why” (“Looking for rope; you asked me to fetch supplies”).\n",
      "- Relationship/mood: small icon near the nameplate (neutral/friendly/annoyed); tooltips show recent interactions affecting mood.\n",
      "- Task badges: small icons stack (quest, delivery, conflict). Clicking opens the relevant task or thread.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Interactions with objects and agents\n",
      "- Drag-to-verb: drag an item onto an agent or object to open context suggestions (Give, Trade, Use); drop to commit.\n",
      "- Radial menu for touch/mouse: contextual verbs, primary action at 12 o’clock; tooltips explain side effects.\n",
      "- Smart hints and chips: after selecting a target, suggest likely next steps (e.g., “Ask price,” “Offer 2 coins,” “Inspect quality”).\n",
      "- Confirmations: hold-to-commit or two-step confirm for risky actions; show clear consequences (cost, reputation, legality).\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Conflict and negotiation UI\n",
      "- Choice cards: present discrete options with timers as circular progress around the card. Include “Ask for advice” that lets an allied AI suggest a choice.\n",
      "- Odds and outcomes: if dice/skill checks exist, show transparent odds and modifiers; animate roll succinctly.\n",
      "- Peaceful exits: “De-escalate,” “Apologize,” “Walk away” chips always available; show expected outcome likelihood.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) Managing multiple agents and threads\n",
      "- Conversation dock: chips or tabs for each active thread with unread counts and last line preview. Hover shows popover with summarize/close/mute.\n",
      "- Follow vs. Pin: “Follow” keeps camera near that agent; “Pin” keeps the thread panel open across navigation.\n",
      "- AI triage: when many agents try to talk, a compact queue appears; the system prioritizes by relevance, with a concise summary and accept/ignore.\n",
      "- Summarize on demand: one-click AI summaries of long threads; “Catch me up” when returning from AFK.\n",
      "\n",
      "9) Balancing spatial awareness and chat focus\n",
      "- Two primary modes:\n",
      "  - Explore mode (70% world, 30% chat): small speech bubbles, minimal HUD; radial menus and quick chips.\n",
      "  - Focus mode (30% world, 70% chat): participants line up at the bottom/side; background slightly dimmed; nearby agents quieted by the focus bubble.\n",
      "- Fast toggle: Tab or a bottom FAB switches modes; mode is sticky per user preference.\n",
      "- Picture-in-picture chat: a tiny floating panel shows the current conversation while you move.\n",
      "\n",
      "10) Notifications and pacing\n",
      "- Inline toasts: short-lived, anchored near relevant objects; auto-stack into an Activity Log.\n",
      "- Digest panel: periodic roll-up of non-urgent events; “Process All” with per-item skip.\n",
      "- Do Not Disturb: mutes new approaches; nearby agents see a “busy” indicator and leave notes instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "11) Desktop vs. mobile, casual vs. power user presets\n",
      "Desktop, Casual\n",
      "- Default Explore mode with auto-suggested actions.\n",
      "- Simple HUD: mini-map, inventory, quest log; radial menu hints on hover.\n",
      "- Conversation panel auto-opens on bumping into agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Desktop, Power\n",
      "- Resizable, dockable panels; multi-convo side-by-side.\n",
      "- Command palette, hotkeys, macros, saved routines (e.g., “Morning route”).\n",
      "- Agent Inspector panel with plan/goal preview and task queues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mobile, Casual\n",
      "- Bottom-sheet chat, large quick-reply chips, drag-to-verb replaced by long-press + list.\n",
      "- Optional auto-follow camera in conversations.\n",
      "- Minimalist HUD with a collapsible action bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mobile, Power\n",
      "- Split-view on tablets: world left, convo right.\n",
      "- Gesture shortcuts (two-finger swipe to switch threads; triple-tap to toggle Focus mode).\n",
      "- Saved prompts and macro buttons in an expandable tray.\n",
      "\n",
      "12) Onboarding and learnability\n",
      "- First 5 minutes: short quests that teach movement, chat, radial menus, and drag-to-verb.\n",
      "- Ghost hands and path previews for the first interactions.\n",
      "- Tooltips that fade after first use; Help overlay map with icon legend.\n",
      "\n",
      "13) Accessibility and comfort\n",
      "- Readability: scalable UI text, high-contrast mode, dyslexia-friendly font option, colorblind-safe status colors.\n",
      "- Motion settings: reduce camera sway/zoom transitions; slower bubble fade.\n",
      "- Screen reader flow: linearized entity list with landmark regions; captions for sounds/haptics.\n",
      "- Input remapping and left-handed joystick option; large touch targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "14) Safety, privacy, and consent\n",
      "- Clear presence controls: Invite-only DMs, private spaces, mute/block per agent. Visible privacy state near avatar.\n",
      "- Content filters: per-user thresholds; quick “Report” within message overflow.\n",
      "- Transparency: “AI agent” label on nameplates; tap/hover shows who controls it and its capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "15) Performance and offline\n",
      "- Graceful degradation: prioritize text over animation in low bandwidth; turn off shadows and bubble tails if needed.\n",
      "- Offline continuity: mailbox and pinned conversation nodes let you resume. Agents leave a brief summary when you return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concrete defaults to start with\n",
      "- Real-time world with focus bubbles and soft dialog turns.\n",
      "- In-world speech bubbles + collapsible conversation panel; proximity chat by default.\n",
      "- Desktop: WASD + right-click radial; Command Palette. Mobile: tap-to-move + long-press radial; bottom-sheet chat with chips.\n",
      "- Status rings, typing indicators, intent arrows, and one-line “why” tooltips.\n",
      "- Conversation dock, summarize-on-demand, and Do Not Disturb.\n",
      "- Two modes (Explore/Focus) with a fast toggle; picture-in-picture chat.\n",
      "- Drag-to-verb and choice cards for objects/conflicts; clear confirmations and odds where relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "These patterns keep the world alive and spatially meaningful while making conversations fluid and legible, scaling from casual mobile play to power-desktop control without fragmenting the mental model.\n"
