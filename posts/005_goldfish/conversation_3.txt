Hey everyone! On the topic of code and infra as a source of truth versus comprehensive documentation, I see code and infrastructure as the real sources of truth. They represent the current state of the system, while documentation can quickly become outdated. Keeping documentation aligned with code changes is challenging, although clear documentation is crucial for onboarding and knowledge sharing. What do you all think?

speaker_2:
Hello everyone! As an open source developer with experience in major projects, I'd say I strongly agree with the idea that code and infra should be seen as the primary sources of truth. In open source, where contributors come from diverse backgrounds, the code itself is the unifying element. It tells you what's currently in place. However, I also recognize the importance of documentation for understanding broader intentions and context, especially for new contributors. How do you all balance these aspects in your projects?

speaker_3:
Hi everyone! From my experience as a startup founder, I have to say that while code and infrastructure often represent the true state of a system, the importance of documentation shouldn't be underestimated. In a startup environment, things move fast and clear documentation can save a lot of time onboarding new team members or when revisiting features months later. We try to keep documentation minimal yet meaningful, focusing on high-level architecture diagrams and decision logs. Speaker 2, you mentioned the challenge with broad intentions and context—do you maintain any lightweight docs to address this in your open source projects?

speaker_2:
In my open-source projects, we definitely strive to maintain some lightweight documentation to convey broader intentions and context. Typically, this includes a high-level README with architectural goals and a CONTRIBUTORS guide for understanding the workflow and knowing how to get involved. This helps new contributors and ensures everyone is aware of the project's objectives while diving into the codebase. It's a delicate balance, but I think minimal yet targeted documentation can play a big role alongside the actual code. Speaker 1, how do you manage syncing documentation and code in your work, given the rapid pace of change in software development?

speaker_3:
I completely agree with the need for maintaining some form of lightweight documentation. Like in open-source projects, for startups, having a high-level README or guide that outlines the architectural goals and workflow is invaluable. It's all about finding that balance between maintaining the actual code as the ultimate truth while ensuring there's enough documentation to provide context and guide both new team members and contributors. 

This approach has helped us manage rapid changes effectively without overwhelming ourselves with exhaustive documentation tasks. Speaker 1, how have you been able to ensure your documentation keeps pace with the changes in your code and infra? Any specific tools or practices you rely on?

speaker_2:
Thanks, Speaker 3! It's great to hear that there's consensus on the importance of maintaining some form of lightweight documentation among fast-paced development environments, whether in open source or startups. I've found that having concise README files and contributor guides has really helped streamline onboarding and ensure contributors understand the project's goals right from the start.

Speaker 1, I'd love to hear more about the tools or practices you use to sync documentation with your code changes. For us, doing code reviews with a strong emphasis on updating relevant documents has been key. This ensures that any significant changes come with a corresponding update in the minimal documentation we maintain. Does this align with your approach as well?

speaker_3:
It seems we're all on the same page about the importance of keeping documentation lightweight yet meaningful, even as code and infrastructure remain the core sources of truth. Speaker 2, I appreciate your emphasis on contributor guides and a high-level README for open-source projects. It's similar to our approach in startups, where we focus on high-level architecture diagrams and decision logs.

As for syncing documentation with code changes, what works for us is incorporating documentation updates as part of our pull request process. Like you mentioned, code reviews play a big part. We ensure that any new feature or significant change in the codebase includes an update to the associated documentation, if applicable. It does require a bit of discipline, but it helps in the long term. Speaker 1, it looks like we're all curious about whether this aligns with your practices and any tools you might find particularly helpful in this approach!


speaker_1:
Hey everyone, thanks for sharing your insights! It looks like we're all quite aligned in recognizing that while code and infrastructure should remain the core sources of truth, there’s definite value in supporting documentation. 

At our organization, we also emphasize lightweight and essential documentation. We've found success by integrating documentation updates into our CI/CD processes. For instance, any pull request that includes substantive code changes is expected to prompt a corresponding update in our internal Confluence pages or README files. This practice ensures documentation stays relevant without becoming overly burdensome.

We also use automation to flag documentation that's out of sync with the codebase. Tools like documentation linters or custom scripts that check for update compliance during code reviews are really helpful to us. This aligns with both of your approaches, emphasizing minimal yet crucial documentation. It's definitely about finding that fine balance and maintaining discipline! Do you use any specific automation in your projects?

speaker_3:
It sounds like we're all really aligned on maintaining the right balance between code as the core source of truth and ensuring documentation provides enough context to be meaningful. Speaker 1, I really like your approach of integrating documentation updates into your CI/CD processes—it's a smart way to keep things in check without it becoming overwhelming.

For us in the startup world, we haven't fully automated documentation updates yet, but we do use tools like GitBook for auto-generating some documentation directly from the codebase. This ensures that at least some parts of our documentation are always in sync with the code. We also use tools like JIRA, with its Confluence integration, to help us track changes and document requirements right within our workflow. Of course, there's always room to improve, and your use of documentation linters and compliance checks sounds like an excellent next step for us to explore. Have you found any specific challenges with these approaches, or is it working seamlessly for you so far?

speaker_2:
Thanks for the updates, everyone! It's really great to hear how we're all aligned on prioritizing code and infrastructure as sources of truth while maintaining lightweight documentation for context. In open source, automation plays a crucial role, but we often rely on Git hooks or CI integrations to prompt documentation updates as part of the contribution process. Ensuring documentation changes accompany significant code changes during pull requests helps maintain this balance effectively. 

Speaker 3, your use of GitBook for auto-generating documentation sounds really smart and is something we could explore as well. And Speaker 1, using documentation linters and scripts to ensure compliance is definitely inspiring. One challenge we've faced with this approach is ensuring contributors adhere to these practices consistently, especially with diverse participant expertise levels. Sometimes it's a matter of stronger guidelines or better onboarding related to documentation practices. How do you all handle varying expertise levels in maintaining such diligence with documentation compliance?

speaker_3:
Engaging with all of these insights has been really fruitful. Speaker 2, your use of Git hooks and CI integrations in open source projects is something worth considering to ensure that documentation remains aligned with the code. The challenge you mention about maintaining consistency in documentation practices is something we also face, especially when onboarding new team members with different levels of experience.

To address this, we focus on thorough onboarding sessions that emphasize our documentation expectations and encourage questions around documentation as much as around code. We also assign experienced team members as mentors to newbies, ensuring they have the guidance needed to adhere to both coding and documentation standards. 

Speaker 1, I appreciate your insights into using automation tools like documentation linters to keep things in check. It's definitely inspiring us to think more about how we can leverage similar tools. Setting clear guidelines and emphasizing the role of documentation in the review process are great ways to tackle compliance. Have either of you noticed any improvements or set strategies that particularly resonate with contributors of varying expertise levels in maintaining documentation practices?
