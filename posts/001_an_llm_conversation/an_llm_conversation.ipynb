    "I'm interested in creating a stupidly simple chat environment and letting some models talk to each other. I think it would be cool to find some measurements of the social characteristics of these LLMs. I'm going to start by evaluating (incredibly subjectively) the ways in which we can let AI can interact with other AIs. For the purposes of these experiments, I'm going to only be using OpenAI's models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To heavily butcher philosophy, Hegel argued that the conflict between a thesis and antithesis can synthesize a better understanding of the world. In this post, I'm wondering if LLMs can have a discussion about a complex topic to teach an outside observer something that they didn't know before. I find myself often working together with AI when looking at system design problems, programming help, and writing rather than it seeming like a one-sided request and response format, so I'm curious if we could take that a step further, looking mainly for information synthesis and the generation of novel ideas.\n",

    "What I want to eventually get to here is basically a much less productionized version of [Microsoft's open-source framework Autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen), only considering textual conversation between two models.\n",

    "Ultimately, my long term goals are to explore how we can develop and evaluate conversational paradigms for LLMs."

Just a few notes to end off on, it seems like a compromise was always achieved. I'm wondering what this would look like for a more polarizing discussion where the middle ground isn't so clear yet. Maybe something like an emerging news story or policy.\n",

Consider multiple of these conversations running in parallel, with access to search and MCP tooling to ultimately translate these discussions into clear results like documents, meetings, etc. (quality control might be a nightmare though). \n",

If we were to let two LLMs talk to each other for some period of time, what would that conversation look like, and where would it go? Would there be room for us to join in and maybe learn a thing or two? "
