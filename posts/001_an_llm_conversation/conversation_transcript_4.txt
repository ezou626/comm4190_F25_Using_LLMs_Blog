Speaker 1
Code, testing, and dev infra should be prioritized over comprehensive documentation.


Speaker 2
I understand where you're coming from—code, testing, and infrastructure are crucial for the immediate functionality and reliability of a software project. They ensure the product works and scales as needed. However, comprehensive documentation plays a vital role in the long run. It provides knowledge transfer, aids in onboarding new team members, and ensures that the system can be effectively maintained and updated. 

Inconsistently prioritizing these elements over documentation can lead to misunderstandings and technical debt, especially when team changes occur. Wouldn't a balanced approach that considers the long-term benefits of documentation complement your focus on code, testing, and infrastructure, enhancing overall project viability?


Speaker 1
Your point about the long-term benefits of comprehensive documentation is valid—documentation does serve as an essential tool for knowledge transfer and onboarding. However, the core argument is about prioritization. In the fast-paced world of software development, where deliveries are often time-sensitive and resources limited, ensuring that the codebase is robust, well-tested, and supported by reliable infrastructure should take precedence.

Consider the short lifecycle of many software tools and projects; a product's viability often hinges on rapid iteration and deployment. Investing in high-quality, automated testing, for example, not only catches issues early but also greatly reduces the need for documentation by making the code itself more self-explanatory. Similarly, solid dev infrastructure can mitigate risks and streamline processes, which is critical during growth phases or major updates.

While documentation certainly has its place, emphasizing solid code and automated testing reduces the dependency on extensive documentation. Code that is clean and self-explanatory can empower developers to understand and modify it with minimal need for written guides. Additionally, well-crafted testing scripts serve as a template for expected behavior, providing insights that documentation might not fully capture.

It’s important not to eliminate documentation but to focus our priorities on practices that directly contribute to software resiliency and agility.


Speaker 2
You make a compelling case for prioritizing code quality, testing, and development infrastructure, especially in fast-paced environments. These elements are indeed crucial for maintaining a product's viability, ensuring rapid iteration, and deploying robust solutions. Well-written, self-explanatory code and comprehensive automated tests can significantly alleviate the dependency on detailed documentation for understanding the system's functionality and intended behavior.

Still, while these practices can reduce some documentation needs, they can't entirely replace it. Documentation provides context that even the cleanest code might not capture. This includes design rationales, architectural decisions, and implementation strategies—insights that are vital during onboarding and when making architectural shifts or refactoring decisions. 

Therefore, while it's understandable to focus efforts primarily on code, testing, and infrastructure during critical development phases, incorporating a scalable level of documentation that covers these higher-level aspects can be a strategic investment in the project's longevity and adaptability. Finding a middle ground—where critical documentation is maintained without overshadowing other priorities—can provide a solid framework for both the present and future of the project.


Speaker 1
Your point about the irreplaceable value of documentation, especially concerning design rationales and architectural decisions, is indeed crucial for understanding the system's context. These elements cannot always be discerned through code alone, even when it's well-written. However, the middle ground you advocate for can still align closely with my stance if approached strategically.

One way to achieve balance is to integrate documentation as a natural extension of existing development processes. For instance, integrating documentation tasks directly into version control and continuous integration pipelines ensures that important updates are captured without disrupting coding priorities. Tools that generate documentation directly from the codebase can also provide a minimal level of necessary documentation.

Moreover, prioritizing comprehensive onboarding programs and pairing new developers with experienced team members can effectively compensate for the reduction of explicit documentation. This approach not only accelerates knowledge transfer but also ensures a deeper practical understanding of the system, which is often more beneficial than static texts.

While some targeted documentation is necessary, embedding contextual notes within the code itself and sharing architectural decisions through team discussions can create a more dynamic and maintainable repository of knowledge. By integrating these practices, we provide the necessary scaffolding for long-term adaptability without diluting the focus on core development activities.
