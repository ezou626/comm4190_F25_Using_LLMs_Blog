Code, testing, and dev infra should be prioritized over comprehensive documentation.


Speaker 2
I see where you're coming from, as code, testing, and dev infrastructure are critical for functional and maintainable software. They directly affect the product’s stability and performance. However, comprehensive documentation plays a vital role in ensuring the longevity and adaptability of a project. It aids in onboarding new team members, clarifies project goals, and facilitates collaboration. Prioritizing documentation can prevent knowledge silos and reduce the bus factor, ultimately saving time and resources in the long run. Balancing both technical and documentation aspects might be the optimal approach. What are your thoughts on how to find that balance?


Speaker 1
I agree that comprehensive documentation has its benefits in facilitating collaboration and ensuring continuity. The balance could be achieved by integrating documentation into the development process, but without letting it overly delay releases or become a bottleneck. Agile practices can be insightful here—maintaining succinct, high-value documentation that evolves throughout the development lifecycle. This dynamic approach ensures that documentation supports the team without stalling code and infrastructure improvements. Automation tools can also ease this integration by generating documents from code itself, ensuring up-to-date and relevant content without much manual effort. What do you think about using such tools to keep documentation efficient yet effective?


Speaker 2
I agree that integrating documentation into the development process, especially within an Agile framework, can strike a good balance. It allows teams to focus on providing just enough documentation to be useful without it becoming burdensome. Automation tools that generate documentation directly from the code base can be incredibly effective in maintaining accuracy and reducing the time developers spend on documentation. Tools like Javadoc for Java or Sphinx for Python can document code as it evolves, capturing changes more consistently.

However, generated documentation might not cover broader architectural or design decisions that aren't directly reflected in the code. A combination of automatically generated docs and targeted manual documentation could provide the most comprehensive solution. By ensuring critical aspects of the project are well-documented, development teams can maintain momentum on code and infrastructure without sacrificing the quality of documentation. Would you consider this hybrid approach feasible in practice?


Speaker 1
Absolutely, a hybrid approach is quite feasible and arguably optimal in practice. Automating documentation for code-specific details can save significant time and ensure accuracy while allowing developers to focus on writing manual documentation where it matters most—like architectural overviews, design decisions, and rationale behind choices that aren't easily captured in code comments. This layer of human-focused documentation can provide critical context that automated tools might miss. 

Moreover, this strategy could help maintain up-to-date documentation as it becomes part of the version-controlled codebase, reducing the risk of outdated information. Encouraging peer reviews of both code and its corresponding documentation can further enhance quality and ensure alignment between them. In your experience, what strategies have you found effective in keeping manual documentation as efficient and worthwhile as possible?
