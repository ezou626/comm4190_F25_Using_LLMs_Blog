speaker_2:
Hello everyone! I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on using code, tests, and infrastructure as the source of truth compared to having detailed documentation. My view leans towards having code as the definitive source since it's the end product that runs, but I acknowledge the value detailed documentation can bring, especially for onboarding new team members or when getting into complex systems. How do others feel about balancing these aspects?

speaker_3:
Hey, everyone! From my experience as a founder, I've often favored code, tests, and infrastructure as the primary sources of truth since they're the executed pieces directly impacting our systems and products. They're inherently reliable in reflecting the current state of the application. However, the lack of documentation can make the onboarding process for new team members more challenging and slow. For complex systems or when making significant architectural decisions, having comprehensive documentation can provide valuable insights and context that code alone might not convey. How do you all handle this balance in your projects?

speaker_2:
I see we're on the same page. My experience in open source aligns with using code and tests as a central source of truth. They undeniably showcase the latest working state of a project, and in open source, where contributors frequently change, this is invaluable. Yet, the initial onboarding can indeed be daunting without some level of documentation.

I'm curious, have any of you tried integrating automated documentation tools, like those that generate docs from code comments or tests? This could offer a middle ground between maintaining comprehensive documentation and ensuring the documentation stays up to date.
