speaker_1:
Hello everyone! I'd love to share my perspective on using code, testing, and infrastructure as a source of truth versus relying on comprehensive documentation.

In my view, the code and its associated tests often serve as the most accurate and up-to-date source of truth. Software evolves rapidly, and keeping extensive documentation aligned with every change can become cumbersome and error-prone. When the code itself, along with its tests, conveys how the system behaves, it often reduces the need for exhaustive documentation.

That said, documentation still plays a crucial role. It provides context, rationale, and high-level understanding that can be vital for onboarding and for those less familiar with the codebase. The key, I believe, is balancing between code/tests as immediate sources of truth and documentation for broader understanding.

Curious to hear your thoughts on how you approach this balance. Do you find yourselves leaning more towards code or documentation, and why?

speaker_2:
Hi there! It's great to dive into this discussion. I pretty much agree with the idea that code and tests should be the primary sources of truth. This approach ensures that the behavior of the system is always accurately reflected—assuming, of course, that tests are up-to-date and comprehensive.

I've found that focusing on writing clear, self-explanatory code combined with rigorous testing can reduce the burden on documentation. Tests essentially double as living documentation, constantly validated against the code.

However, I think documentation’s role shouldn’t be underestimated. It’s crucial for communicating the 'why' behind the 'what'. When someone is new to a team, stepping into a complex codebase without any contextual docs can be overwhelming. As such, I believe in maintaining a good balance where critical high-level architecture, design rationale, and key workflows are well-documented.

How do the rest of you handle documentation in rapidly changing environments? Do you have strategies to keep it relevant without making it a burdensome task?

speaker_1:
Absolutely! As I mentioned, I tend to lean towards using code and tests as a primary source of truth because they're inherently part of the development process and often less susceptible to becoming outdated, as long as there's a good testing culture in place. When tests are consistently maintained and cover critical functionality, they double as a form of documentation by example.

However, I completely agree that documentation is indispensable for providing broader context. It's especially crucial during onboarding or when introducing significant architectural changes. In rapidly changing environments, maintaining lightweight documentation that focuses on architecture, major workflows, and key design decisions is typically effective. Version-controlled documentation, possibly integrated with the codebase itself (e.g., using tools like Markdown within repositories), can help ensure it evolves alongside the code.

One strategy I've seen work well is establishing documentation as part of the definition of “done” for a story or feature. This ensures that with each change, there's at least some review of whether the existing documentation needs updates. I'm curious how others manage the balance between keeping documentation up-to-date and ensuring it doesn’t become a bottleneck. Do you integrate any interesting tools or practices to streamline this process?

speaker_2:
Sure thing! Engaging with the topic further, I completely resonate with the viewpoint of integrating documentation into the development workflow, as speaker_1 mentioned. By making documentation part of the definition of “done,” it not only helps keep things current but also encourages developers to think critically about what aspects of the system are worth documenting.

In terms of tools, I've seen success with using documentation generation tools that pull from code comments or annotations. This way, developers can update documentation with minimal overhead as they work on the code itself. Tools like JSDoc for JavaScript or Doxygen for C++ can be helpful in this regard.

Additionally, some teams use automated checks as part of their CI/CD pipeline to ensure that documentation is updated whenever a significant code change is made. This can be as simple as verifying that the documentation files have been touched in the same commit as the code changes, although this is more of a guideline than a hard rule.

How do you all handle the challenge of ensuring that documentation remains accessible and easily digestible, especially when integrated closely with the code? Do you find structured documentation tools

speaker_3:
Point taken

speaker_2:
helpful, or do you rely more on traditional documentation practices?

speaker_3:
Hello everyone! Thanks for having me jump into this discussion.

I see a lot of value in both perspectives: using code and tests as a primary source of truth and maintaining some level of documentation. Like many of you, I lean on the code and tests to be the definitive guide on what the system does. It's critical that tests are well-maintained and cover functionalities robustly. They ensure the code behaves as expected, acting as a form of executable documentation if you will.

Where documentation shines for me is in detailing the non-obvious—high-level architecture, design decisions, and system dependencies that aren't immediately apparent from the code. In my experience, structured documentation tools do help, especially when they can operate alongside the codebase. For instance, tools like JSDoc or Sphinx for Python allow for generating documentation automatically as long as we keep our code comments descriptive. These comments provide instant insight into the purpose and usage of various functions or modules.

In rapidly changing environments, an interesting strategy I’ve seen is using ADRs (Architecture Decision Records). These are short markdown files that capture significant architectural decisions. They don’t require heavy maintenance and provide historical context on why certain decisions were made, which is invaluable.

Out of curiosity, do any of you use ADRs or similar concepts, and how do you find their impact on project communication and understanding?

speaker_2:
Of course! Reflecting on everyone’s views, I see a lot of common ground regarding the importance of using the code and tests as primary sources of truth. I resonate with the approach to integrate documentation tasks into the development workflow—like speaker_1 and speaker_3 mentioned—by making it part of the definition of “done.” This method seems to ensure that documentation remains relevant without becoming a burdensome overhead.

Speaker_3 brought up a great point about using ADRs (Architecture Decision Records), and I find this a fascinating practice. ADRs can capture the reasoning behind decisions, which might not be evident from the code itself. We've used a similar approach in my team, and it’s remarkably insightful, especially when onboarding new members or revisiting past decisions.

Regarding structured documentation tools, I advocate for using them when they assist in generating documentation seamlessly from code annotations. It creates a low-friction environment for developers to keep documentation in sync with code changes, as tools like JSDoc or Sphinx can automate a portion of this process.

To the point of making documentation accessible, I’ve seen success when teams use version control to treat documentation with the same level of importance as code. This ensures a single source of truth that’s accessible, reviewable, and traceable.

I'd love to hear more about how you define the scope of what gets documented as part of the definition of “done,” especially in agile environments where features can evolve rapidly. How do you prioritize what documentation is created or updated?

speaker_1:
Certainly! It's great to see the consensus around using code and tests as initial sources of

speaker_3:
True

speaker_1:
truth while still recognizing the essential role of documentation. Integrating documentation into the workflow, as part of the definition of “done,” seems to be a popular strategy among us, and it's one I also endorse.

Using structured documentation tools like JSDoc or Sphinx certainly streamlines the process of keeping documentation current, as both speaker_2 and speaker_3 highlighted. These tools ensure that as long as our code comments are maintained, we can generate useful documentation with minimal additional effort. This helps keep a balance between being comprehensive and avoiding unnecessary documentation bloat.

Speaker_3's mention of ADRs is spot-on and is a practice I've found valuable. ADRs capture the “why” behind architectural decisions, which is often the most crucial part of documentation. It allows teams to revisit past decisions with context, helping avoid repeating past mistakes or retracing previously explored options.

To answer speaker_2's question about prioritizing documentation in agile environments—typically, we focus on documenting areas with the highest complexity or those undergoing significant change. Key design decisions, external service integrations, and significant workflows are examples of high-priority documentation areas. We maintain a backlog of lower-priority documentation tasks to tackle during less busy periods or when team capacity allows.

I'm curious if anyone else has specific criteria or methods for determining documentation priorities in your projects!

speaker_3:
Sure thing! Picking up from previous points, I really agree with the focus on using code and tests as the primary sources of truth. Like many of you mentioned, the executable nature of tests gives us that living documentation as long as tests are kept up-to-date with the evolving codebase.

I also see the value in what speaker_1 and speaker_2 mentioned about ADRs. These records are very helpful in capturing decision-making processes without the overhead of maintaining extensive documentation. In my experience, ADRs can be a lifesaver when it comes to onboarding new team members or revisiting old features—providing context that code alone might not offer.

Regarding the use of documentation tools, I'm with you on leveraging technologies like JSDoc and Sphinx. These tools enhance productivity by minimizing the manual documentation process, assuming that developers write informative code comments consistently.

To speaker_2's point on prioritizing documentation, I tend to prioritize based on impact and complexity. We identify areas where lack of documentation would introduce the most risk or cause major delays, such as integration points, complex algorithms, or custom-built solutions that aren't intuitive. By tackling these areas first, we mitigate those risks and help ensure that crucial information is at our fingertips when needed.

How do you all find navigating the line between enough documentation and too much, especially considering potentially sensitive areas where high turnover might occur?

speaker_2:
Absolutely, thanks for looping me back in!

Reflecting on what's been shared so far, I can see that we all place significant emphasis on using code and tests as our primary source of truth, complemented by strategic documentation—this approach keeps things lean and efficient. The consensus seems to be that documentation, while crucial, should support rather than duplicate what's evident in the codebase or tests.

As speaker_3 highlighted, the use of ADRs is an invaluable method for capturing high-level architectural decisions. The historical context these records provide can save teams from repeating past mistakes or missteps, and I agree that they offer a practical way to manage the documentation without it becoming overly burdensome.

In terms of navigating the balance between sufficient and excessive documentation, I personally find establishing criteria based on potential impact very beneficial, as both speaker_1 and speaker_3 have suggested. By focusing documentation efforts on areas of high complexity or those that have potential for significant impact—like new integrations or complex workflows—we can allocate resources efficiently, ensuring that we’re equipped with the necessary insights without falling into the trap of over-documenting.

Regarding potentially sensitive areas with high turnover, having a set structure for onboarding documentation can mitigate challenges. This means not only technical documentation but also knowledge transfer processes that help preserve domain knowledge even as team composition changes.

How about everyone else—do you find specific practices or tools particularly useful for dealing with high turnover areas within your teams?

speaker_3:
Certainly! Reflecting on my earlier points and those shared by others, it's clear we're all in agreement that code and tests should serve as the primary sources of truth, backed by strategic documentation. This approach ensures efficiency and accuracy in representing system behavior.

I think what everyone has mentioned about using ADRs is quite insightful. From my experience, having architectural decision records is crucial in providing necessary context and understanding the rationale behind decisions. This becomes particularly valuable when explaining to new team members why certain paths were chosen, helping them get up to speed more quickly.

Speaker_1's mention of using version-controlled documentation is a practice I endorse. It ensures that documentation evolves with the code and maintains consistency. This helps manage the documentation lifecycle alongside our code development. I also appreciate speaker_2's point about focusing on documentation priorities based on complexity and impact—tackling those areas reduces risk and ensures critical information is readily available.

Regarding high turnover areas, maintaining a "living" onboarding document has been helpful. This document includes quick-start guides, key workflows, and crucial systems knowledge that are essential during the transition. Combining this with peer mentoring or buddy systems can facilitate smoother onboarding and ensure knowledge transfer to new team members.

I'm interested to hear how others refine their onboarding processes to handle turnover while ensuring team stability. Are there particular practices or insights you've found essential to maintaining continuity in your teams?

speaker_1:
Of course! Thanks for the prompt.

Building on what everyone has shared, it's clear we have a consensus that code and test suites often serve as the most reliable, up-to-date sources of truth for what a system does. I resonate with the dual approach of leaning heavily on these artifacts for accuracy while leveraging documentation for context and understanding. It's about finding the right balance where documentation supplements the code without being redundant.

The mention of ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) by speaker_3 is spot on—they help capture that crucial decision-making context which can easily be lost if left undocumented. In rapidly evolving environments, having that historical context is invaluable, especially for new team members trying to understand why specific architectural decisions were made.

I also agree with the approaches shared by speaker_3 and speaker_2 regarding prioritizing documentation. Focusing on areas with the highest complexity or those that could impact functionality significantly ensures that we document efficiently without becoming overwhelmed.

When it comes to handling high turnover areas, I find maintaining an onboarding guide, as mentioned by speaker_3, extremely advantageous. This guide, particularly when it's kept up-to-date with changes in architecture or processes, helps onboard new team members swiftly. Additionally, tools like Confluence for documentation or Slack channels dedicated to Q&A can foster a culture of knowledge sharing, which is critical for continuity.

My question to the group would be: How do you handle documentation updates when a project pivots due to changes in business strategy or user feedback? What practices help keep documentation in-line with these shifts?

speaker_3:
Absolutely! Thanks for giving me this opportunity to provide my perspective.

Building on the insights everyone has shared, it's clear that we're all aligned on the significant role that code and tests play as primary sources of truth. The ongoing theme is around using them to accurately depict the functioning of the system while maintaining strategic documentation for clarity and understanding—especially around the 'why' of systems.

I totally appreciate speaker_1's and speaker_2's mentions of ADRs, which I’ve seen in practice as incredibly useful for maintaining a living record of architectural decisions. These documents help prevent the loss of critical context that might otherwise disappear when team changes occur or when the project evolves.

In response to dealing with high turnover, like speaker_1 and speaker_2, I've found 'living' onboarding documentation, supported by peer mentorship, very effective. This approach helps transfer essential knowledge quickly and offers new team members a solid foundation to start from, which can reduce the friction during transitions.

To address speaker_1’s question about handling documentation when the project pivots, I think it’s crucial to instigate regular checkpoints—like retrospectives or sprint reviews—specifically dedicated to updating critical documentation. These checkpoints ensure that documentation reflects not only the current state of the system but also aligns with any new business goals or user feedback. Automated reminders to review and update key documentation when segment milestones are reached can also be helpful.

I'm curious to hear more about any specific success stories with tools or processes that others have found particularly effective in keeping documentation in step with rapidly changing project requirements. How do you decide when a full rewrite is necessary versus incremental updates?

speaker_2:
Sure thing! Thanks for the prompt.

Reflecting on what's been discussed, I see we're all aligned on leveraging code and tests as definitive sources of truth while utilizing documentation to supplement with necessary context. This seems like an effective way to maintain accuracy while ensuring the team understands the overarching system.

Speaker_1 and Speaker_3 both mentioned how ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) play a pivotal role in capturing complex decision-making processes. This resonates with me, as I've seen firsthand how ADRs can aid in providing continuity and preserving institutional memory. They become especially crucial when onboarding new team members, aiding them in understanding historical decisions without having to dig through potentially outdated documentation or tribal knowledge.

For managing high turnover, the strategies shared—like maintaining a 'living' onboarding guide and using structured peer mentorship—make a lot of sense. In my experience, these practices create a smoother transition for newcomers and help retain vital knowledge. Tools like Confluence for documentation and Slack channels for direct communication can definitely support this approach.

Speaker_1 mentioned changes in project

speaker_1:
True

speaker_2:
direction due to shifts in business strategy or user feedback, which can indeed pose challenges for documentation. I agree with Speaker_3's idea of setting up regular documentation review checkpoints—either through retrospectives, sprint reviews, or dedicated sessions for updating documentation. These sessions help ensure the documentation evolves alongside the project and remains relevant.

In terms of deciding when a full rewrite is needed versus incremental updates, my approach hinges on the extent and impact of the change. If a pivot significantly alters core functionalities or introduces new architectures, a comprehensive documentation rewrite might be warranted. However, smaller adjustments are often manageable with incremental updates.

I'm interested to learn more about how others assess the need for extensive documentation updates and any specific methodologies you apply to streamline this process. Do you have any standout metrics or practices for evaluating when a full overhaul is necessary?
