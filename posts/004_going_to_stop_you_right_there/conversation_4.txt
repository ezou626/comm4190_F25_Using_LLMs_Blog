speaker_1:
Hello everyone! It's great to join this discussion. When it comes to relying on code, tests, and infrastructure as sources of truth versus maintaining comprehensive documentation, I lean towards the former. Code, tests, and infrastructure configurations are living entities that evolve with the project, providing an accurate and up-to-date representation of the system as it exists. They are less prone to becoming outdated, which is a common problem with static documentation.

That said, documentation still plays a crucial role, especially for onboarding new team members, clarifying high-level design decisions, and providing overviews for stakeholders. Ideally, documentation should complement what exists in code and be automated wherever possible to ensure consistency. 

What are your thoughts on maintaining this balance between accuracy and comprehensiveness?

speaker_2:
Of course! I have a slight preference for code and tests as the primary source of truth. They tend to be more reliable because they’re executed regularly, catching discrepancies early. However, I acknowledge the importance of documentation, especially to provide context that isn't always evident from the code alone.

An effective strategy I've seen is generating documentation from the codebase itself. For example, using tools that extract and compile docstrings or comments into cohesive documentation. This keeps docs up-to-date with the code releases. It's akin to having the best of both worlds — accuracy-driven code/tests and accessible documentation.

I'm curious how others manage infrastructural configurations as they often seem separate from the codebase. How do you ensure these remain a reliable source of truth?

speaker_3:
Hello everyone! I'm glad to join the conversation. I agree that code and infrastructure as a source

speaker_2:
Apologies! Happy to wait and learn from others' insights. 

speaker_1:
Certainly! My perspective aligns closely with what speaker_2 said about leveraging code and tests as primary sources of truth. They naturally evolve alongside the project, reducing the risk of becoming outdated. Infrastructure configuration can be a bit trickier, but embracing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) helps ensure that our infrastructure setup is version controlled and can be tested just like application code.

When it comes to managing infrastructure configurations, using tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation allows for easy tracking of changes and integrating them into the CI/CD pipeline. This approach ensures consistency and reliability, keeping the state of infrastructure in sync with the codebase. 

As for documentation, I heavily rely on README files directly in the repository and tools like Doxygen or Sphinx to generate documentation from comments in the code. This keeps everything together and reduces duplicative effort.

Speaker_2 and speaker_3, how do you see automated documentation impacting the balance between up-to-date accuracy and providing essential context? Do you have specific tools or methodologies you use to bridge this gap?

speaker_2:
Definitely! I'll echo the point on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) being a game changer for maintaining up-to-date configurations as our source of truth. With tools like Terraform, as speaker_1 mentioned, you can effectively track changes and audit your infrastructure. This makes the infrastructure much more robust and maintainable, aligns it with the rest of the codebase, and keeps everything in sync.

Regarding automated documentation, I've found that while it ensures accuracy by staying close to the codebase, it can sometimes miss the conceptual narratives or broader explanations that contextualize why certain decisions were made. I often supplement automated documentation with ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) to track the key choices and reasons behind them. This helps fill in those contextual gaps and provides a historical insight into the code's evolution.

Speaker_1 and speaker_3, have you found ways to automate the integration of this kind of narrative documentation or integrate these tools smoothly into your workflow?

speaker_1:
Of course! Continuing the discussion, I definitely see the value in what speaker_2 mentioned about Architecture

speaker_2:
All right

speaker_3:
I apologize for interrupting earlier!

speaker_2:
Understood, apologies for that! Let’s dive back in. As you both brought up, using architecture decision records (ADRs) alongside Infrastructure as Code seems to provide a solid balance between maintaining up-to-date configurations and capturing the broader context. 

When automated documentation is generated directly from the codebase, it typically covers the "how" but not always the "why." Combining these methods with ADRs allows us to document the rationale behind decisions without risking outdated information since they're treated as part of the code versioning.

Now, integrating these seamlessly into workflows can be challenging, but what I've found effective is incorporating documentation requirements into the Definition of Done for our teams. We've also implemented a practice where significant Pull Requests require a linked ADR or an update to an existing one, which keeps everything aligned and contextually relevant.

Speaker_1, you mentioned using tools like Doxygen or Sphinx; how do you find they support this integration, especially in relation to the manual documentation of narratives or decisions?

speaker_1:
Absolutely! I find tools like Doxygen or Sphinx incredibly helpful for generating API documentation directly from code comments, which ensures that documentation stays closely aligned with the codebase. This is particularly useful for detailed technical specifications of functions and classes.

As speaker_2 pointed out, while such tools excel at documenting the "how," they might not fully capture the "why." That's where integrating ADRs into our workflow can really enhance the narrative aspect. By documenting key decisions in ADRs and linking them within the generated documentation, we create a comprehensive system that captures both the technical details and the context behind them.

These tools can be automated as part of the deployment pipeline, ensuring that documentation is updated alongside code releases. By including manual narrative documentation in our Definition of Done, similar to what speaker_2 does, we consistently ensure that any decision-making process forms an integral part of our documentation strategy.

Speaker_3, how do you see this approach fitting into your current practices, and have you encountered challenges in maintaining this balance?
