    "## Randomness as Interjections\n",
    "We're going to try to continue improving on the authenticity and naturalness of the conversations we're generating. One issue with LLM conversations is how structured they are, even without incredibly formal language or long responses. The fact that each model gets to (and needs to) completely finish before the next one can speak means that things that often happen in real conversations (interruptions, affirmations, etc.). This is not something that our paradigm explored [last time](https://ezou626.github.io/comm4190_F25_Using_LLMs_Blog/posts/003_approaching_a_true_discussion/Spontaneity.html) has changed with random speaker ordering and potentially skipping speakers. \n",

Also, integrating documentation updates into development workflows using PR processes and code reviews is crucial.\n",

    "## Closing Remarks\n",
    "In general, while these seem to make the conversation appear more natural from a bird's eye view, there are evidently issues with the approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, because LLM's operate with text, the introduction of interjections in the way done here doesn't really model the way an interjection appears in real life conversations (separation vs. mixing, in that order). This could cause interjections to not be as effective in their intended purpose, or worse, interrupt the conversation flow. A potential remedy to this would be to reframe the problem as looking at an online chatroom and only allowing interjections at punctuation marks like periods or paragraph breaks. In that way, it's much more like a chat conversation where messages are delivered in whole pieces without chance of interruption in the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, I think there's also an opportunity to develop speaker personas to enforce consistent actions across multiple messages. When speakers are prompted, there is a chance they may not remember what they are trying to work on, and there's no way in the current simulation environment to differentiate one speaker from the other except in the order in which they speak. Maintaining a consistent state for each speaker could go a long way in ensuring better defined speakers, and as a result, more diverse conversations. Additionally, we may be able to use these personas to inform actions like interruptions or cutoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Future Work:**\n",
    "> - There's definitely an opportunity to develop speaker-level context that can be delivered in the message generation prompt. This would allow a more rich representation of the speaker's internal thoughts, and this could even be managed by an LLM.\n",
    "> - There's also an opportunity to make some of these random things motivated by this context or the conversation, asking the AI if it wants to do a specific action given it's current position.\n",
    "> - It might be cool to have a general framework that considers all of these possible scenarios and allows for the simulation of these kinds of conversations with different models, parameters, etc. "
